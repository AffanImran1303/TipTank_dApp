      <p className="relative">TipTank, your platform for directly supporting the creators you admire! Our mission is to empower artists, writers, musicians, educators, and other creatives by providing a seamless way for fans to show appreciation for their work through tips and contributions.</p>

      <p className="m-12">In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, creators put countless hours into producing valuable content, often without the security of a steady income. TipTank addresses this by offering a decentralized, user-driven space where fans can easily tip creators as a way to recognize and support their efforts. Unlike traditional platforms, TipTank operates on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, lower fees, and a fairer system that benefits creators more directly.</p>
